# "Say Hi!", they said

Hey! Iâ€™m Andrii aka [@anleo](https://github.com/anleo) from Ukraine. 

Nowadays I'm positioning myself as JS developer. I'm interested in Frontend technologies as much as Backend ones, including databases, real-time messaging and so on. Also I have an average expertise in Design & UI/UX. Not a big fan of drawing, but I'm pretty sure I can advice in some cases related to this field. 
I still don't know what exactly I should learn or do nowadays and to grow in which field, but I'm curious enough to keep moving! ;)
